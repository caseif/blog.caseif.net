	<p class="heading" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -16px;">About Me</p>
	<p>I'm a programmer who sometimes writes/vents on this website. I mainly develop in Java, although I (obviously) do a bit of web development on the side. On that front, I'm familiar with Javascript, PHP, JSP, and Python. (Also, my TI-BASIC skillz are totally off the charts.) The reason I originally got into Java development was so that I could write <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/profiles/caseif">Bukkit plugins</a> (more in-depth baclstory <a href="http://www.caseif.net/post.php?id=21">here</a>), some of which I still develop/maintain to this day.</p>
	
	<p>I also play video games on the occasion. Usually <i>Rocket League</i> or <i>Skyrim</i> (both of which I've put an unhealthy amount of time into), or sometimes just a random indie game.</p>
