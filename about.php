	<p class="heading" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -16px;">About Me</p>
	<p>I'm a programmer who sometimes writes/vents on this website. I mainly develop in Java, although I (obviously) do a bit of web development on the side. On that front, I'm familiar with Javascript, PHP, JSP, and Python. (Also, my TI-BASIC skillz are totally off the charts.) The reason I originally got into Java development was so that I could write <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/profiles/caseif">Bukkit plugins</a> (more in-depth baclstory <a href="http://www.caseif.net/post.php?id=21">here</a>), some of which I still develop/maintain to this day.</p>
	
	<p>Right now, my main projects include <a href="https://github.com/LapisBlue/Pore">Pore</a>, an API bridge that provides <a href="https://spongepowered.com/">Sponge</a> servers with compatibility for <a href="https://bukkit.org/">Bukkit</a> plugins, <a href="https://github.com/LapisBlue/Nocturne">Nocturne</a>, a tool for creating Java deobfuscation mappings, and <a href="https://github.com/caseif/TTT">TTT</a>, a Minecraft clone of <i>Trouble In Terrorist Town</i>. I work on Pore and Nocturne with the <a href="http://lapis.blue/">Lapis</a> organization, who focus specifically on Sponge and Minecraft development and are generally awesome people. I work on TTT by myself. :(</p>
	
	<p>I also play video games on the occasion. Sometimes I play <i>Team Fortress</i>, sometimes <i>Skyrim</i> (which I've put an unhealthy amount of time into), and sometimes just a random indie game.</p>
