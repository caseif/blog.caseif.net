	<p class="heading" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -16px;">About Me</p>
	<p>I'm a student programmer currently attending University of Maryland who sometimes writes/vents on this website. I
	mainly develop in Java, although I also dabble in other languages (C, C++, Golang) and (obviously) do a bit of web
	development on the side. On that front, I'm familiar with Javascript, PHP, JSP, and Python. But perhaps what I'm
	most proud of is my proficiency in none other than TI-BASIC.</p>
	
	<p>A big part of the reason I got into programming was in order to make my own
	<a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/profiles/caseif">Minecraft mods</a> (which I'm now doing as freelance work).

	<p>Leisure activities include eating and aimmlessly wandering campus with friends. I also play video games on the
	occasion. Usually <i>CoD Zombies</i> or <i>Skyrim</i> (both of which I've put an unhealthy amount of time into), or
	sometimes just a random indie game.</p>
