		<p>
			I'm a freelance software developer currently working with
			<a href="https://www.rc-gamers.com/">RC-Gamers</a> who sometimes
			writes/vents on this website. I mainly develop in Java, along with a
			few other languages (C, C++, Golang), and I do a bit of web
			development on the side (JS, PHP, JSP). But of course, none of that
			can compare to my unmatched expertise in TI-BASIC.
		</p>
		<p>
			Leisure activities include hobby software projects, eating, and
			continuously indulging my coffee addiction. I also play video games
			from time to time. My favorites are <i>Skyrim</i>, <i>Age of Empires
			2</i>, and <i>CoD Zombies</i>, but I also enjoy the occasional random
			indie game.
